# Counter App
This project might seem simple, but it helped me dive into key React topics like:

✅ JSX and functional components
✅ Using useState for managing state
✅ Passing data between components through props
✅ Handling user input and events
✅ Creating a dynamic and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
